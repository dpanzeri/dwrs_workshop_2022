# Practical session 2

<i>Mapping deep-water fishing grounds: from fishing tracks to fishing effort maps</i>

This repository contains all the material needed for the practical session 2. Starting from pre-classified deep-water fishing tracks, R scripts used to estimate and map metrics of fishing pressure in the context of the GFCM-DWRS framework will be introduced and shared. The session will be focused on a pilot GSA. An hands-on exercise related to all the topics covered during the day is also foreseen.
