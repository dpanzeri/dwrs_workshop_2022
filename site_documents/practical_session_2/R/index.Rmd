## Introduction

This documents accompain the R code used in the **Practical session #2** - *Mapping deep-water fishing grounds: from fishing tracks to fishing effort maps*.
It aims to detail part of the workflow adopted to elaborate Automatic Identification System (AIS) data in the context of the GFCM initiative to map fishing ground for deep-water red shrimp in the Eastern-Central Mediterranean Sea. The focus is on some of the plots shown in the chapter 3.4 of the report, in particular those referring to the aggregated fishing effort (Figure 1 a and b) and to the DCF indicators of fishing pressure (Figure 1 c and d).

## Structure

This document is structured into three sections that will be approached within the lesson:

 - *Processing and analysis*: here is presented the entire workflow that would be shown during the lecture. Starting from fishing tracks, data are intersected with a spatial grid. The results are aggregated in different ways to produce fishing effort metrics and indicators.
 
 - *Functions*: contains the customized functions used repeatedly within the code. 
 
 - *Exercise*: this section contains the instructions needed to complete the lecture exercise.
