<p>This release note aims to describe the AIS processing method hosted in the repository (<a href="https://github.com/MAPSirbim/AIS_data_processing/tree/v1.0.1" class="uri">https://github.com/MAPSirbim/AIS_data_processing/tree/v1.0.1</a>), also available at 10.5281/zenodo.4757505. The processing workflow was developed on historical annotated data of the Adriatic Sea (Mediterannean Sea) and aims to (i) identify individual fishing trips and (ii) classify them on a monthly basis according to 5 predefined gear classes: bottom otter trawl (OTB), pelagic pair trawl (PTM), beam trawl (TBB), purse seine (PS), and “other” fishing (OTHER, including dredges and passive gears).</p>
<p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="practical_session_1/AIS_data_processing/documents/conceptual_workflow.jpeg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Figure 1: Conceptual framework of the worflow used in AIS data processing</p>
</div>
<p>In the repository we also release:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>a small subset of AIS signals broadcasted by a few vessels retrieved from the validated dataset (.csv);</p></li>
<li><p>all the parameters required to process the data, such as the input parameters needed to classify fishing trips (.csv) and the trained Random Forest model (.rds) used to finally assign the gear on a monthly basis and finalized to work in the Adriatic Sea;</p></li>
<li><p>additional spatial layers required by the data processing (.shp). <br></p></li>
</ul>
<div id="input-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Input data</h1>
<p>Input data required to start the workflow are described below. <br></p>
<div id="vessel-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Vessel data</h2>
<p>The workflow was originally created to be applied to AIS data. However, it can be adapted to every positioning data type having the following structure:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data = read.csv(&quot;practical_session_1/AIS_data_processing/data/datatest.csv&quot;)
head(data)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   MMSI            datetime longitude latitude speed
## 1    1 2015-04-01 17:47:53   13.5027  43.6154   5.3
## 2    1 2015-04-01 17:52:54   13.4914  43.6291  10.2
## 3    1 2015-04-01 17:57:55   13.4914  43.6291  10.2

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>MMSI (Maritime Mobile Service Identity): is the unique identifier in official AIS data. For privacy purposes, the MMSI was converted into a fake id (e.g., “1”)</li>
<li>date and time: timestamp (in the format of Universal Time Coordinate) of broadcasted positions</li>
<li>latitude and longitude: coordinates of the broadcasted positions (WGS 84)</li>
<li>speed: instantaneous speed over ground (SOG) of the vessel (kn) <br></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="spatial-layers" class="section level2">
<h2>Spatial layers</h2>
<p>Three vector layers are required to perform the functions foreseen by the workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>ports (.shp). Port locations were stored as point buffers or manually designed, to best include approach channels to ports, and described by following attributes: name, country and statistical Area (for our scope we use GFCM Geographical Sub-Area; GSA).</li>
<li>coastal_ban_zone (.shp). Zone where the use of towed gears is prohibited, as defined by Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006. It is bounded by 3 nautical miles of the coast or by the 50 m isobath where that depth is reached at a shorter distance from the coast.</li>
<li>grid (.shp). It is the spatial grid used to aggregate fishing effort and estimate fishing hours. The grid provided in this repository is available here.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>These layers cover the Mediterranean basin and should be manually recreated in order to reproduce the processing workflow in different areas. <br></p>

<div id="fishing-trip" class="section level2">
<h2>Fishing trip</h2>
<p>The create_fishing_trip function identifies vessel-specific fishing trips for each vessel, as sequences of points broadcasted by a vessel, from the time it leaves the port until it returns. To run the function, four datasets are required to complete the entire workflow: the sequence of AIS positions of a vessel, the coastal_ban_zone layer, and 2 layers related to the ports. As AIS transmission gaps (loss of signal of at least 30 minutes) can hamper the identification of the departure and arrival ports, a recovery function was internally applied to join consecutive trips where the departure/arrival port was too far to be assigned. In order to join consecutive trips the function overlays the ending/starting points with the coastal_ban_zone, compares ids between consecutive ending/starting points, compares timestamps and forces a starting and ending port for each trip. In particular, fishing trips are joined and the nearest port is assigned if ending and starting points are consecutive, have a temporal distance shorter than 24 h and at least one is outside the coastal_ban_zone. At the end of the recovery process, for trips that still miss departure and/or arrival ports, the internal function closest_port_recovery is used to force port assignment under other conditions.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dat_trip= create_fishing_trip(data = dat, 
                              ports = ports,  
                              ports_buffer = port_buf, 
                              coastal_ban_zone = coastal_ban_zone)</code></pre>

<p>The fishing trip table created above is required to assign the fishing trip id to the AIS signals of the vessels. However, the fishing trip table can be useful to store summary information of the fishing trips of a vessel and used to recall records belonging to single trips by using the starting and ending timestamp. In addition, it may be linked with the port layer where information regarding the country and GSA is stored.</p>
<p>
<p>The function assign_trip assigns to each AIS position the trip to which it belongs.</p>

<h2>Fishing trip classification and gear assignment</h2>
<p>The classification_wrapper function applies a cascade of classification algorithms on each fishing trip, using as input the AIS positions with their assigned trip (dat_with_trip) and the specific parameters needed for each classification algorithm (pars). The classification of each fishing trip is done by two internal functions (classify_speed and search_cluster), whose results are used to label each fishing point according to the speed clusters (in the case of towed gears) or spatial clusters (in the case of PS).</p>
<p>
<p>In particular, a k-means algorithms is performed on trip-specific speed values using 5 different sets of centroids that were a priori defined by experts for each fishing gear type (two for OTB, PTM, TBB and PS), the centroids will represent the different speed profiles of fishing behavioural states. The dbscan algorithm is applied on the latitude and longitude data, with two different sets of neighborhood radii (??) and a number of minimum points in the ?? region. The proportions of points falling within each of the identified clusters are used to label the fishing trip as positive or negative to each of the investigated gears.</p>

<p>In order to accommodate the intra-month variability of the predicted gears, fishing gears are finally reassigned to trips on a monthly basis appling a Random Forest model (RF) using the Random Forest library available in R (Liaw and Viener, 2002). The classification unit of the RF is the set of fishing trips performed in a month by a vessel.</p>
<p>
<p>Before training the RF, 524 known vessels (8463 units) are randomly stratified while splitting up into 2 datasets (90:10, dataset 1 and dataset 2, respectively) according to the number of vessels by gear class. The dataset 1 (7572 units) is further splitted in 70:30 equally portioning among the 5 gears (Training and Validation, respectively) to allow model tuning. The dataset 2 (891 units) is used as a test to evaluate classification performance and transferability of the trained RF. <br></p>

<p>The decision_gear function uses the trained RF to predict the fishing gear for each month. The features used to predict the monthly gear consist in the ratio between the trips labelled as positive for each gear and the total number of the fishing trips (ratio_otb1; ratio_otb2; ratio_ptm; ratio_tbb; ratio_ps).</p>

<h2>Estimate fishing effort</h2>
<p>Finally, the estimate_fishing_effort function returns a grid populated with cumulative fishing time for the period covered by the input data (hours fishing vessels spent operating gear in each grid cell). Fishing tracks were intersected with the 0.1? grid and durations were computed for each output feature. For towed gears, fishing hours are calculated by dividing resulting lengths by the inherited mean fishing speed. For the purse seiners, fishing hours are calculated by assigning the duration of the cluster to its centroid. The cumulative fishing time was quantified spatial joining each cell with overlapping centroid/portions of hauls, and summing relative durations.</p>
