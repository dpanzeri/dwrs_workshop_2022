## Description
<p align="justify"> 
The workshop is aimed to analyze AIS data and map fishing effort, sharing R scripts. First, a theoretical session will be dedicated to show AIS-based scientific applications in fishery management and introduce the R processing workflow. Two practical sessions will thus be carried out to differentiate according to the programming levels of participants and break the processing workflow into: (i) management/classification of AIS data, and (ii) estimation of fishing effort and its mapping. Course material is available at <a href="https://github.com/irbimMAPS/dwrs_workshop_2022">https://github.com/irbimMAPS/dwrs_workshop_2022</a>.

<br>

<ul>
  <li>09:30: Theoretical session - Use of AIS in DWRS fishery management
  <li>11:00: Practical session #1 (entry level R users) - Processing and classification of AIS data: from raw data to fishing tracks.
  <li>12:30: Lunch break
  <li>14:00:Practical session #2 (advanced R users) - Mapping DW fishing grounds: from fishing tracks to fishing effort maps
  <li>16:30:Final recap and closing
</ul>
<br>

### Theorical session - Use of AIS in DWRS fishery managment
<ul>
  <li> Identification and mapping of bottom trawl fishing grounds for DWRS in the Eastern-Central Mediterranean Sea.
  <li> Introduction to the workflow to map AIS-based fishing effort.
</ul>
<br>

### Practical session #1
<p align="justify"> 
Processing and classification: from AIS raw data to fishing points. Starting from AIS pings, the workflow is based on the procedures available at  <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4761890">https://zenodo.org/record/4761890</a>. It was developed on historical annotated data of the Adriatic Sea and aims to (i) identify individual fishing trips, (ii) classify them on a monthly basis according to predefined gear classes, and (iii) identify fishing pings/hauls. We will also spend some time understanding AIS datasets and R scripts, preparing you to handle your own data in a reproducible manner. 
 </p>
<br>

### Practical session #2
<p align="justify"> 
Mapping deep-water fishing grounds: from fishing tracks to fishing effort maps. Starting from pre-classified deep-water fishing tracks, R scripts used to estimate and map metrics of fishing pressure in the context of the GFCM-DWRS framework will be introduced and shared. The session will be focused on a pilot GSA. An hands-on exercise related to all the topics covered during the day is also foreseen.
